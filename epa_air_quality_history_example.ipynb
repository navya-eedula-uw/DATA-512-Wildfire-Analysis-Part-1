    "# US EPA Air Quality System API Example\n",
    "This example illustrates how to request data from the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Air Quality Service (AQS) API. This is a historical API and does not provide real-time air quality data. The [documentation](https://aqs.epa.gov/aqsweb/documents/data_api.html) for the API provides definitions of the different call parameter and examples of the various calls that can be made to the API.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook works systematically through example calls, requesting an API key, using 'list' to get various IDs and parameter values, and using 'daily summary' to get summary data that meets specific condistions. The notebook contains example function definitions that could be reused in other code. In general, the notebook explains each step along the way, referring back to possible output. Some of the explanations are tailored to the specific example requests of the API. Changing values to explore the results of the API is probably useful, but that will result in some explanations being out of sync with the outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The US EPA was created in the early 1970's. The EPA reports that they only started broad based monitoring with standardized quality assurance procedures in the 1980's. Many counties will have data starting somewhere between 1983 and 1988. However, some counties still do not have any air quality monitoring stations. The API helps resolve this by providing calls to search for monitoring stations and data using either station ids, or a county designation or a geographic bounding box. This example code provides examples of the county based and bounding box based API calls. Some [additional information on the Air Quality System can be found in the EPA FAQ](https://www.epa.gov/outdoor-air-quality-data/frequent-questions-about-airdata) on the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "The end goal of this example is to get to some values that we might use for the Air Quality Index or AQI. You might see this reported on the news, most often around smog, but more frequently with regard to smoke. The AQI index is meant to tell us something about how healthy or clean the air is on any day. The AQI is actually a somewhat complext measure. When I started this example I looked up [how to calculate the AQI](https://www.airnow.gov/sites/default/files/2020-05/aqi-technical-assistance-document-sept2018.pdf) so that I would know roughly what goes into that value.\n",

The monitoring system is complex and changes all the time. The EPA implementation allows an API user to find changes to monitoring sites and sensors by making requests - maybe monthly, or daily. This API approach is probably better than having the EPA publish documentation that may be out of date as soon as it hits a web page.

The function takes parameters for `email_address` and `key`, which are necessary for accessing the API, and assigns them to a `request_template` if provided. If either is missing, it raises an exception. The function then constructs a request URL by combining the API’s base URL and action for list requests, formatted with the template values. Before sending the request, a throttle delay is applied to avoid surpassing API rate limits. The function attempts to make a `GET` request, parses the response as JSON, and handles any errors by printing the exception and returning `None`. "

    "Hence, the function `extract_AQI_data` was created. The `extract_AQI_data` function is designed to process the JSON response received from an air quality index (AQI) API request. It checks the status of the response to determine whether the request was successful. If the status indicates \"Success,\" the function extracts and returns the relevant AQI data, which consists of a list of dictionaries, each representing daily measurements for various sensors. If the status begins with \"No data,\" the function does nothing and simply exits, implying that the request may need further inspection. In the event of any other status, it prints an error message along with the full JSON response for debugging purposes. If the function encounters any issues, it returns `None` to indicate that no valid data could be extracted. This function is integral to handling the response from the AQI API, allowing users to retrieve meaningful air quality data while managing potential errors effectively. \n",

    "To perform this calculation, I used the **Haversine distance** formula. The Haversine formula calculates the great-circle distance between two points on a sphere given their latitude and longitude. This is okay to use for small distances where Earth’s curvature is minimal. For this, I utilized the `pyproj` library in the data acquisition code, which provides a fast and efficient calculation, especially suited for shorter distances. Other distance calculation methods proved slower on my computer and this seemed like a reliable enough method for this context."

    "### Methodology to Fill in the Missing AQI values\n",
    "\n",
    "I implemented a function to calculate AQI (Air Quality Index) values on a daily and yearly basis from a dataset containing air quality measurements for specific pollutants. If any AQI values are missing, the function fills these gaps by calculating AQI values based on EPA-defined concentration-to-AQI mappings.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **EPA Breakpoints** are essential for this calculation. Each pollutant (such as CO, SO2, NO2, O3, PM2.5, and PM10) has defined concentration ranges, known as \"breakpoints,\" which correspond to specific AQI levels. These breakpoints are structured as tuples that define low and high concentration limits, each paired with corresponding AQI values. By referencing these, the function can determine which AQI level matches a given pollutant concentration.\n",
    "\n",
    "To identify each pollutant, the **Parameter Mapping** section assigns specific codes in the dataset to pollutant names. This makes it easier for the code to cross-reference the pollutants in the dataset with the breakpoints defined in the EPA standards, enhancing readability and simplifying the AQI calculation process.\n",
    "\n",
    "The logic to perform this calculation is taken directly from The [AQI Calculator](https://www.airnow.gov/aqi/aqi-calculator/) from the [https://www.airnow.gov](https://www.airnow.gov) website.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **calculate_individual_aqi** function converts concentration values to AQI levels by referencing the breakpoints for each pollutant. Using a linear interpolation formula provided by the EPA, it calculates AQI for any given concentration. If the concentration data is missing, the function returns `NaN`, ensuring that missing data is handled properly.\n",
    "\n",
    "The AQI calculation process then proceeds to fill in any missing values in the DataFrame. First, the code creates a copy of the input DataFrame, then adds a `parameter` column to map pollutant codes to pollutant names. If the `AQI` field is missing for a row, it calculates AQI using the pollutant concentration and type. \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the code aggregates the data both daily and yearly. It groups the data by `date_local` to find the maximum AQI level for each day, as the daily AQI is typically represented by the highest AQI level among all pollutants for that day. To create yearly data, the code extracts the year from each date and averages AQI values for each year, creating a new column called `average_aqi`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The function returns two DataFrames: `daily_aqi`, which holds daily AQI values, and `yearly_aqi`, containing yearly averages. This method ensures the dataset is complete and accurate, following EPA standards, and provides a thorough AQI calculation for both daily and yearly analysis."
