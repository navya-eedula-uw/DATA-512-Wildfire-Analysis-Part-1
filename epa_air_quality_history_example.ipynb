    "# US EPA Air Quality System API Example\n",
    "This example illustrates how to request data from the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Air Quality Service (AQS) API. This is a historical API and does not provide real-time air quality data. The [documentation](https://aqs.epa.gov/aqsweb/documents/data_api.html) for the API provides definitions of the different call parameter and examples of the various calls that can be made to the API.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook works systematically through example calls, requesting an API key, using 'list' to get various IDs and parameter values, and using 'daily summary' to get summary data that meets specific condistions. The notebook contains example function definitions that could be reused in other code. In general, the notebook explains each step along the way, referring back to possible output. Some of the explanations are tailored to the specific example requests of the API. Changing values to explore the results of the API is probably useful, but that will result in some explanations being out of sync with the outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The US EPA was created in the early 1970's. The EPA reports that they only started broad based monitoring with standardized quality assurance procedures in the 1980's. Many counties will have data starting somewhere between 1983 and 1988. However, some counties still do not have any air quality monitoring stations. The API helps resolve this by providing calls to search for monitoring stations and data using either station ids, or a county designation or a geographic bounding box. This example code provides examples of the county based and bounding box based API calls. Some [additional information on the Air Quality System can be found in the EPA FAQ](https://www.epa.gov/outdoor-air-quality-data/frequent-questions-about-airdata) on the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "The end goal of this example is to get to some values that we might use for the Air Quality Index or AQI. You might see this reported on the news, most often around smog, but more frequently with regard to smoke. The AQI index is meant to tell us something about how healthy or clean the air is on any day. The AQI is actually a somewhat complext measure. When I started this example I looked up [how to calculate the AQI](https://www.airnow.gov/sites/default/files/2020-05/aqi-technical-assistance-document-sept2018.pdf) so that I would know roughly what goes into that value.\n",

    "Once you have a key, the next thing is to get information about the different types of air quality monitoring (sensors) and the different places where we might find air quality stations. The monitoring system is complex and changes all the time. The EPA implementation allows an API user to find changes to monitoring sites and sensors by making requests - maybe monthly, or daily. This API approach is probably better than having the EPA publish documentation that may be out of date as soon as it hits a web page. The one problem here is that some of the responses rely on jargon or terms-of-art. That is, one needs to know a bit about the way atmospheric sciece works to understand some of the terms.\n",

    "This code defines `request_list_info`, a function that retrieves various metadata lists from the AQS API, such as groups or parameter class descriptors. This information is essential for identifying specific air quality measurement codes, allowing users to later make targeted requests using proprietary 5-digit codes. The function takes parameters for `email_address` and `key`, which are necessary for accessing the API, and assigns them to a `request_template` if provided. If either is missing, it raises an exception. The function then constructs a request URL by combining the API’s base URL and action for list requests, formatted with the template values. Before sending the request, a throttle delay is applied to avoid surpassing API rate limits. The function attempts to make a `GET` request, parses the response as JSON, and handles any errors by printing the exception and returning `None`. This setup simplifies retrieving API parameter descriptions and codes required for more specific air quality data requests."

    "Hence, the function `extract_AQI_data` was created. The `extract_AQI_data` function is designed to process the JSON response received from an air quality index (AQI) API request. It checks the status of the response to determine whether the request was successful. If the status indicates \"Success,\" the function extracts and returns the relevant AQI data, which consists of a list of dictionaries, each representing daily measurements for various sensors. If the status begins with \"No data,\" the function does nothing and simply exits, implying that the request may need further inspection. In the event of any other status, it prints an error message along with the full JSON response for debugging purposes. If the function encounters any issues, it returns `None` to indicate that no valid data could be extracted. This function is integral to handling the response from the AQI API, allowing users to retrieve meaningful air quality data while managing potential errors effectively. \n",

    "Following the function definition, the code initializes a dictionary, `request_data`, using a template that includes the user's email and API key, as well as state and county information specific to Centennial, CO."
